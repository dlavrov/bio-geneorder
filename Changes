0.9a	02/17/2009
	First version.  Requires bioperl-1.5.2, no earlier, no later.

0.9.1	2/19/2009

      Requires bioperl-1.6.0 stable release.

    o Bio::GeneOrder::gene
      - Added recognition for "/note=codons recognized:XXX"

    o Bio::GeneOrder::SetIO::nexus
      - Changed 'missing' symbol for 'copies' encoding from "?" to "0"

    o gnorder
      - Added STDOUT output for comparison matrices
      - Added open/save shortcuts for importing go files
      - Added distance/shared/copies commands for quick comparisons
      - Added NJ/UPGMA commands for displaying pairwise distance trees

0.9.2 2/25/2009
    
    o Several speed and memory usage improvements
    o Pairwise distances are now calculated correctly
    o Annotations without tags are recognized as "unknown"
    o Checks for anticodons already in gene names
    o Genomes names now don't contain "mitochondrion"
    o Comment support for 'go' files
    o Names of removed gene orders are displayed after removal
    o Added -names option to "list" command
    o The GeneOrder::bound object has been discontinued
    o Added -local option to "ignore -genes" command
    o Copies encoding always uses numbers now.
    o Added text wrapping for large matrices
    o Added gene order indices at top of matrices

0.9.3 5/01/2009

    o Several speed and memory usage improvements
    o 'ignore' and 'limit' commands have been replaced by 'filter' and 'purge' commands
    o Matrix headers begin numbering from 1
    o Added 'reorder' command
    o Modifications to the 'compare' command
    
0.4 
	09/01/2009

    o Restructured entire system
    o Using a new version number scheme
    o The underlying gene order data structure is simply a packed array of integers
      and a common gene naming key is maintained throughout sets of gene orders
      this saves significant amounts of memory and makes it possible
      to calculate distances faster and more easily with XS routines
    o Updated compare command to display shared intervals
    o Eliminated several methods from GeneOrder::Set
    o Eliminated GeneOrder::Gene object
    o Integrated an XS C library for computing common distance measures
      including inversions, breakpoints, adjacencies, DCJ, common intervals.
      Also included are methods for estimating correcting distances for inversions and DCJ
      as well as inversion median solvers (Caparara, etc.)
    o All of these distance measures are (soon to be) available through 
      associated gnorder commands "inversions" "adjacencies" "breakpoints" "DCJ" "intervals"
    o Versioning and change tracking have been moved to the code.google.com/p/bio-geneorder
	  subversion repository
